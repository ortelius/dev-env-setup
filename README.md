## Welcome to Ortelius in a Box

![Ortelius in a Box!](images/ortelius-in-a-box.jpg "Ortelius in a Box")

## Project Description
The goal is to open up the Microservices world and give visibility to developers so that it does not feel like you are developing with a blind fold on.

Ortelius and its supporting Microservices are deployed into a Kind cluster using Terraform.

DBeaver or any suitable database client for Postgresql can be used to access the Postgresql database. The Postgres database is persisted using volume mounts.

Devspace is the tool for deploying and connecting VS Code to the Dev Container inside the Ortelius namespace. The Dev Container will contain all the tools required for development of the Ortelius technology stack.

Kubeshark can be used by the developer for Microservice API troubleshooting.

The LocalStack extension in your Docker Desktop opens up the cloud world for you to develop against AWS services running locally on your machine.

Leapp is the one ring to rule them all when it comes to cloud provider authentication and role switching.

Thunderclient is a powerful API tester inside VS Code.

The great thing is that this is immutable and transportable to any operating system that supports Docker, Kubectl, Helm, Kind and Terraform.

Whilst I have tried to cover every scenario in the documentation I welcome feedback for any ambiguous or missing instructions.

## Future Endeavours
- Migrate the Ortelius eco-system to AWS using LocalStack.
- Improve the Devcontainer experience.
- Implement our [Event Driven Architecture POC](https://filedn.eu/lJEPcSQWQQPRsWJKijxnXCQ/ortelius/gitops/01-ci-dev-ortelius-cloudnative-architecture-poc.html).

## Pre-requisite checklist
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro)
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Ortelius](https://ortelius.io)

## Developer Tools
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/)
- [DevSpace](https://www.devspace.sh/)
- [Kubeshark](https://kubeshark.co/)
- [Leapp](https://www.leapp.cloud/)
- [Localstack](https://localstack.cloud/)
- [Thunderclient](https://www.thunderclient.com/)
- [Devdocs](https://devdocs.io/)

## Pre Flight Checks & Troubleshooting Tips
- If you have Helm Charts installed run `helm repo update`
- Kube config is expected to be in the default location `$KUBECONFIG`
- If you get an `AJAX` error when trying to login then logout first with `http://localhost:8080/dmadminweb/Logout` or you could use incognito mode (Its a cookie issue)
- If you get incorrect username or password the database is probably borked, destroy and re-deploy
- If everything goes completely haywire manually remove everything such as `*.tfstate` and the Ortelius Docker containers representing the Kind K8s nodes and execute `terraform plan -auto-approve` and `terraform apply -auto-approve`
- Please make sure you have a folder in your root `/tmp/postgres` and please make sure you add this mount point to your Docker Desktop under `Settings --> Resources --> File Sharing` `(/tmp is sufficient)`
- If you are already using ports 8080 or 5432 in your environment you will need to change the ports in `main.tf` here
```
      # ortelius http port | change port 8080 to something else if it clashes with your environment
      extra_port_mappings {
        container_port = 31000
        host_port      = 8080 <-- make the port change here
        listen_address = "0.0.0.0"
      }
      # postgresql port | change port 5432 to something else if it clashes with your environment
      extra_port_mappings {
        container_port = 31316
        host_port      = 5432 <-- make the port change here
        listen_address = "0.0.0.0"
      }
    }
```

## [Ortelius](https://ortelius.io/) | Supply Chain Catalog & DevOps Intelligence
Ortelius is central catalog of supply chain and DevOps intelligence. It is designed to track and version composition details for every component of your software supply chain along with all consuming logical applications. With Ortelius, you can easily view your logical application's SBOMs, CVEs, service dependencies, and inventory based on versions, even in a decoupled microservices architecture.
Ortelius aggregates DevOps, security and supply chain data for each independent component moving through the pipeline. It is particularly useful in cloud-native, microservices architectures where the logical application becomes ambiguous. Ortelius tracks who is consuming shared components, versions them when they are updated and then creates new release candidates for every logical application that is impacted by a component change. It then aggregates that data to the logical application level so you don't have to.
The latest version of Ortelius is maintained by the Ortelius Community managed by the [Continuous Delivery Foundation](https://cd.foundation/) (Linux Foundation). It was originally created by [DeployHub](https://www.deployhub.com/) and [OpenMake Software](https://www.openmakesoftware.com/). Our mission is to simplify the adoption of modern architecture through a world-class microservice catalog driven by a supportive and diverse global open source community.

## [Docker.com](https://www.docker.com/) | Application Containerisation Platform
### [GitHub Docker](https://github.com/docker)

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It uses containers, which are lightweight, standalone, executable packages of software that include everything needed to run the application, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and system tools. Containers provide a consistent, isolated environment for applications to run, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy applications. Docker allows developers to automate the deployment of applications into containers and manage containers as a single unit. It simplifies the process of deploying applications, making it easier to scale applications, and enabling organizations to adopt a microservices architecture.

## [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro) | Provisioning & Managing IaC
### [GitHub Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform)

Terraform is an open-source tool for provisioning and managing infrastructure as code. It provides a simple, declarative syntax for defining infrastructure resources, such as virtual machines, DNS entries, and databases. Terraform can manage popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions. By describing infrastructure as code, Terraform enables versioning, testing, and collaboration of infrastructure changes. Terraform can create, update, and delete resources in parallel, while minimizing the risk of conflicts and errors. Terraform also provides a state management system that tracks changes to infrastructure over time, making it easier to roll back changes if necessary. With Terraform, organizations can automate their infrastructure management processes, improve reliability, and increase efficiency.

#### Logs

In total, there 5 log levels which can be used for debugging purposes:

- `TRACE` one of the most descriptive log levels, if you set the log level to *TRACE,* Terraform will write every action and step into the log file.
- `DEBUG` a little bit more sophisticated logging which is used by developers at critical or more complex pieces of code to reduce debugging time.
- `INFO` the info log level is useful when needing to log some informative instructions or readme type instructions.
- `WARN` used when something is not critical but would be nice to include in the form of a log so that the developer can make adjustments later.
- `ERROR` as the name suggests, this is used if something is terribly wrong and is a blocker.
```
export TF_LOG="DEBUG"
```

## [Kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/) | The Conductor of Containerised Applications

Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerised applications. It provides a unified API for defining and managing containers, enabling organizations to simplify the deployment and scaling of applications. Kubernetes automates the distribution of containers across a cluster of machines and monitors the health of the containers, ensuring that they are always running. It can automatically replace failed containers and ensure that the desired number of replicas are running. Kubernetes also provides built-in service discovery and load balancing, making it easier to connect microservices and ensure that traffic is distributed evenly across the cluster. Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration and is widely adopted by organizations of all sizes.

The component chart allows you to define application components (e.g. a database, an API server, a webserver with static files) and deploy them using Helm. Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes and allows you to manage these components (e.g. upgrading).

#### Why?

Compared to manually creating Helm charts, the component chart allows you to define your application components using a unified Helm chart.

This provides the following benefits:
- 70% less YAML to maintain (only values.yaml for chart)
- Highly flexible configuration via values.yaml
- Fast and easy definition of Kubernetes resources
- Kubernetes best practices (e.g. recommended annotations and labels)
